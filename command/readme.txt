This is a showcase of my first rust project which will help me to learn and better understand rust. 
As time goes on, improvements will be seen in the projects features, the ways I use different rust features, and my overall coding ability in rust.

v 0.2 notes:
After abandoning a different rust project earlier this summer due to its size and required experience/knowledge I decided to continue working on this command line project. I added test cases and the ls command in it's entirety. This includes directories now having a blue color, option arguments working now, and the ability of listing multiple paths from one input. I also modified the command_processing function to include the ability to enter directories that have spaces using either " or ' to enclose the directory. I think for now I am going to take a break from rust since for me it is tedious to do certain tasks in the language and thanks for reading.
